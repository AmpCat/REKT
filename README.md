It is not finsihed yet...

Update to v0.3 - 30/10/2016
  Fixes:  
  - Stopped Kerbals sligding off the pod when on EVA.
  - Adjusted 'door' attachment node.
  - Removed the option to surface mount to the Inline Triple Adapter to resolve 'detaching issues'.
  - Other minor config node and module corrections.
  New:
  - IVA's for all pods.
  - RAMP (REKT Auxiliary Miniature Parachute) desgined specifically to resolve the stock chute clearance issue.

Released as v0.2 - BETA "REKT Escape Pod Mod" - 25/10/16
  This is the first release version - Please note it is still in BETA and feedback is welcomed.
  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you use this mod with the following mods:
  - IndicatorLights
  - Landertron
  
  N.B.  Neither of these are dependencies and the Mod has been designed as a standalone. Module Manager is required for the               implementation of supporting mods Modules but not for REKT if operating as a standalone.
